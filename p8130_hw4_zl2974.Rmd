# Problem 1
In the context of ANOVA model, prove the partitioning of the total variability (sum of squares),
i.e.,
‚àëùëò ùëñ=1 ‚àëùëõ ùëó=ùëñ 1(ùë¶ùëñùëó ‚àí ùë¶Ãø)2 = ‚àëùëò ùëñ=1 ‚àëùëõ ùëó=ùëñ 1(ùë¶ùëñùëó ‚àí ùë¶ÃÖùëñ)2 + ‚àëùëò ùëñ=1 ‚àëùëõ ùëó=ùëñ 1(ùë¶ÃÖùëñ ‚àí ùë¶Ãø)2

__PROOF__
we have by definition, the
$$ y_{ij} - \overline{\bar{y}} = (y_{ij}-\bar{y_i}) + (\bar{y_i} - \overline{\bar{y}})$$

Fixing within group i, we have within group variance:
$$\begin{aligned}
 \sum_j(y_{ij} - \overline{\bar{y}})^2\\
 =\sum_j[ (y_{ij}-\bar{y_i}) + (\bar{y_i} - \overline{\bar{y}})]^2\\
 = \sum_j{ (y_{ij}-\bar{y_i})^2 + (\bar{y_i} - \overline{\bar{y}})^2
 +  2*(y_{ij}-\bar{y_i})(\bar{y_i} - \overline{\bar{y}})}\\
\end{aligned}$$

With $\sum_j y_{ij}/n_j = \bar{y_i}$ and $\sum_j 1= n_j$
$$\begin{aligned}
\sum_j{2*(y_{ij}-\bar{y_i})(\bar{y_i} - \overline{\bar{y}})}\\
= 2\sum_j y_{ij}*\bar{y_i} - y_{ij}*\overline{\bar{y}} - 
\bar{y_i}^2 + \bar{y_i}*\overline{\bar{y}}\\
=2*n_j*\bar{y_i}^2 - 2*n_j*\bar{y_i}*\overline{\bar{y}} - 
2*n_j*\bar{y_i}^2 + 2*n_j*\bar{y_i}*\overline{\bar{y}}\\
rearrange = 2*n_j*\bar{y_i}^2 - 2*n_j*\bar{y_i}^2 
+ 2*n_j*\bar{y_i}*\overline{\bar{y}}-2*n_j*\bar{y_i}*\overline{\bar{y}}\\
= 0
\end{aligned}$$

Now sum over group i we have
$$ \sum_i\sum_j(y_{ij} - \overline{\bar{y}})^2 = \sum_i\sum_j(y_{ij}-\bar{y_i})^2 + (\bar{y_i} - \overline{\bar{y}})^2$$

# Problem 2
A rehabilitation center is interested in examining the relationship between physical status before
therapy (‚Äòbelow average‚Äô, ‚Äòaverage‚Äô and ‚Äòabove average‚Äô) and the time (days) required in physical
therapy until successful rehabilitation. Records from patients 18-30 years old were collected and
provided to you for statistical analysis (dataset ‚ÄúKnee.csv‚Äù).

Assuming that data are normally distributed, answer the questions below:

a) Generate descriptive statistics for each group and comment on the differences observed. (4p)

b) Using a type I error of 0.01, obtain the ANOVA table. State the hypotheses, test statistic,
critical value, and decision interpreted in the context of the problem. (5p)

c) Based on your response in part b), perform pairwise comparisons with the appropriate
adjustments (Bonferroni, Tukey, and Dunnett ‚Äì ‚Äòbelow average‚Äô as reference). Report your
findings and comment on the differences/similarities between these three methods. (5p)

d) Write a short paragraph summarizing your overall results as if you were presenting to the
rehabilitation center director. (1p)

# Problem 3
A research article was published with the following headline ‚ÄúFor adults, chicken pox vaccine may
stop shingles‚Äù. The findings were based on a randomized clinical trial with a total of 420 adults
being randomized to receive either chicken pox vaccine or placebo. While the results were
intriguing, some side effects emerged and required further investigation. The table below
summarizes the frequencies of one of the most frequent and concerning side effect - swelling
around the injection site.
![table](table_1.png)

Use a significance level of 0.05 to assess if the distribution of swelling status is the same for the
two treatment populations.

a) Justify the appropriate test to be used for addressing the question of interest. (2p)

b) Provide the table with all values necessary for calculating the test statistic. (4p)

c) State the hypotheses, test statistic, critical value, p value and decision rule interpreted in the
context of the problem. (4p)
